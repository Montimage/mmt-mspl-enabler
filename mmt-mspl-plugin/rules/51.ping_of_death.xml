<!-- Property 51: This rule aims to detect "Ping of death" attack. Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death
The maximum packet length of an IPv4 packet is 65 535 bytes (2^16 - 1)
The attacker sends a number of IP fragments with the regrouped payload at the end will be an ICMP packet bigger than 65 535 bytes 
that can probably lead to buffer overflow / system crash.
